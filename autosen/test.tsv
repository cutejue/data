Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes.	2M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. || 4M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.

0	5-168	2_1	How does the man describe the short hour of daylight around Christmas in Sweden?	Painful	4W: So what is it like? || 2W: The seasons? || 7M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there's only one hour of daylight, so you really looks forward to the spring. It is sometimes a bit depressing. But you see the summers are amazing, from May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets. It's still light in the midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper. || 9M: Yeah, that's right, but it's wonderful. You won't stay up all night. And the Swedes makes most of it often they started work earlier in summer and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings. They'd like to work hard, but play hard, too. I think Londoners work longer hours, but I'm not sure this is a good thing. || 5M: Well, it is cold, very cold in winter. Sometimes it is cold as 26 degrees below centigrade. And of course when you go out, you'll wrap up warm. But inside in the houses it's always very warm, much warmer than at home. Swedish people always complain that when they visit England, the houses are cold even in the good winter.

But traveling is so expensive. || 5W: Have you thought about camping? I think you'll really like it. You can rent the equipment you need.

Besides, you'll find it easier and convenient to live at the camp grounds for you to take a shower or buy some food there. It's a good way to make new friends, too.

0	2-129	0_0	How many people are there in the woman's family?	Three.	2W: Well, I feel it is very important for families to have regular meals together. One of my good childhood memories was dinner with my parents and two sisters. Because my husband and I both worked and our three children were busy with their studies, we seldom had a chance to get together as a family. But we thought it would be possible for us to sit down and enjoy meals together every week. First we tried setting fixed days: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But almost everyone was unhappy. Then my son had the idea that everyone told his or her most convenient days and I would choose the two best days. For a while the children were still unhappy with the idea. They said they would rather spend the time with their friends playing sports. Gradually, though, they began to see the evenings together as interesting and helpful. We loved a lot.

Unique descriptive skills.	1W: When you write a novel, do you know where you're going, Dr. James? || 2M: Yes, you must, really, if you're writing the classical detective story, because it must be so carefully plotted and so carefully clued. I have schemes. I have charts. I have diagrams. It doesn't mean to say I always get it right, but I do plan before I begin writing. But what is so fascinating is how a book changes during the process of writing. It seems to me that creative writing is a process of revelation, really, rather than of creativity in the ordinary sense. || 10M: Yes. I think this is true. The writer can stand aside from experience and look at it, watch it happening. There is this 'detachment' and I realize that there are obviously experiences which would overwhelm everyone.
