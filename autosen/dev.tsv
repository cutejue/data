And I learnt that men, including me, should always show respect to nature or properly reduce our confidence when saying men can conquer the world. || 1W: Which impresses you more, a book or a movie?

You can prepare for a negotiation quite scientifically, but the execution of the negotiation has quite a lot to do with one's artistic quality. The scientific part of a negotiation is in determining your strategy. What do you want out of it? What can you give? Then of course there are tactics. How do you go about it? Do you take an opening position in a negotiation which differs from the eventual goal you are heading for? And then of course there are the behavioral aspects. || 1W: Mr. Green, is it fair to say that negotiation is an art?

You can pretend that you don't like things which you are actually quite pleased about. Or you can pretend to like things which you are quite happy to do without. Or you can be the honest type negotiator who's known to his partners in negotiation and always plays everything straight.

0	4-1268	0_0	What is the man most probably?	A teacher.	2M: Hello, everyone. I thought Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth was on the whole a good film. It is an excellent film for teachers to show their classes to explain global warming. It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers' will have to skip when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film. I would have respected Al Gore a bit more if he hadn't tried to make this a film about himself as well. || 1W: Let's hear about Mr. Brown's comment to the movie.

The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It starts off with a few diagrams that many of you have probably seen already. This film is really for the general public who do not know all of this, and it is also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together. I think it is a good film, but it is not perfect. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing his election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers' will have to skip when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film. I would have respected Al Gore a bit more if he hadn't tried to make this a film about himself as well. || 1W: Let's hear about Mr. Brown's comment to the movie.

They like to take care of themselves.	1W: Surely having a Granny about the place to give a hand with the housework can take a lot of pressure off a young wife, can't it? || 4M: Yes. As long as old people are able to look after themselves, the system works quite well. But as soon as they need any care and attention, the situation becomes very difficult indeed. It's likely that old people may go into a nursing home, but it's not as simple as that. Because of improvements in medical science, people live longer than ever before. The birth rate has fallen. This means that a smaller working population is having to provide for a larger number of old people in need of care and attention. The number of old people's homes provided by the State is strictly limited. There are private nursing homes, but the cost is out of reach of the average family. || 2M: Yes, I think this is true.

This university keeps up close relations with some British universities, among which is Oxford University. My university and Oxford have an exchange program. Every year Jiaotong University sends several teachers to Oxford; Oxford sends a few professors to Jiaotong. They go to Jiaotong mostly for a few lectures, staying only a few weeks. The Oxford University supplies Chinese teachers with 810 pounds each month. It is all the money I have to cover all my expenses.

Being an English teacher in China, I, of course, do not have to pass the IELTS. || 4Mr. Yuan: Neither the Chinese nor the British government is financially supporting me.
